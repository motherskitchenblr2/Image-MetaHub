## What is Image MetaHub?

Image MetaHub is a desktop app for organizing and browsing large local libraries of AI-generated images, video, audio, and other generative media. It is built for people who have outgrown a normal output folder or basic ComfyUI gallery and need a searchable library that still understands how each generation was made.

It scans your existing folders in place, extracts generation metadata from ComfyUI, Automatic1111, InvokeAI, Forge, and other tools, caches results for fast reuse, and lets you combine metadata search, filters, tags, ratings, collections, lineage, and local visual similarity search. Your files stay on your machine.

## Organize ComfyUI generations at scale

Image MetaHub works as a standalone ComfyUI output organizer for large generation folders. It reads embedded prompt and workflow metadata, lets you search by checkpoint, LoRA, sampler, scheduler, seed, dimensions, node types, tags, ratings, and more, and can send compatible generations back into ComfyUI as working workflows.

You do not need to import your library into a proprietary cloud or reorganize your output folders first. Image MetaHub indexes the files where they already live and can keep watching those folders while ComfyUI generates new media.

## Manage large AI-generation libraries

Image MetaHub is more than an output gallery. It is designed for long-term retrieval and curation across large local collections, with metadata search, visual similarity, tags and ratings, stacks, collections, lineage, compare tools, deduplication helpers, and support for multiple generation ecosystems.

The goal is to preserve the production history around each asset: what prompt, model, LoRAs, workflow, and source image created it, how related generations connect to each other, and how to continue working from it later.

## Getting Started

1. Download the latest desktop release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/LuqP2/Image-MetaHub/releases).
2. Install and launch Image MetaHub.
3. Add one or more folders that contain your generated images or videos.
4. Wait for the first indexing pass to finish.
5. Use search, sidebar facets, tags, and advanced filters to explore the library.

### Windows installer and portable build

Windows releases provide a standard Setup executable and a separate Portable executable. The portable build keeps its settings, browser data, metadata cache and thumbnails in an `ImageMetaHubData` folder beside the executable, without using the Image MetaHub profile in AppData.

To update the portable build, close Image MetaHub, replace only the Portable executable, and keep the existing `ImageMetaHubData` folder beside it.

### macOS unsigned builds

Current GitHub release builds are not signed with an Apple Developer ID yet. If macOS blocks the app after you download and move it to Applications, remove the quarantine flag from Terminal:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Image MetaHub.app"
```

This is a temporary workaround for unsigned builds until macOS signing and notarization are available.

## Browsing and Curation

Image MetaHub is built around fast local curation:

* **Search + facets**: combine free-text search with include/exclude facets for checkpoints, LoRAs, samplers, schedulers, ComfyUI node types, tags, favorites, ratings, generation modes, media types, and advanced ranges
* **Stacking**: group identical prompts in the main library view for faster browsing
* **Sort + Group By**: sort order and grouping live in the persistent grid footer, with grouping by date, name, generation session, checkpoint model, or cluster, plus Jump To navigation
* **Manual tags + ratings**: keep a persistent manual tag catalog, switch included tags between `Any` and `All`, and curate with 1-5 ratings
* **Metadata recovery**: reparse selected images without running a full folder refresh or clearing cache — a single reparse patches only the affected cache chunk, so it stays fast on large libraries
* **Image editor**: adjust, crop, rotate, flip, resize, sharpen, blur, annotate, and redact from the viewer, then Save As a metadata-preserving copy or overwrite eligible originals on desktop
* **Startup verification**: choose whether saved folders reopen from cache, reconcile in the background, or verify strictly before startup completes
* **Shadow metadata**: edit metadata non-destructively and keep the original payload available for inspection or revert
* **Viewer workflows**: in the desktop app, open each image in a separate native window above Image MetaHub while the ComfyUI Workspace stays alive; minimize and restore viewers from the footer, or select the legacy in-app viewer in Settings
* **Auto-watch**: keep output folders in sync while A1111 or ComfyUI is generating

## Find Similar — Local Visual Search

Select any image and find visually related results across your library, including files with no prompt or generation metadata. Processing runs locally using an optional on-device model.

Local Visual Search is off by default. Enabling it does not download anything: the model download is a separate, explicit action, and downloaded files are verified before use. Indexing can be paused and resumed, works offline after the model is installed, and uses optional WebGPU acceleration with an automatic WASM fallback.

Find Similar is the primary supported workflow in v0.19. Experimental text-to-image queries are also available, but their results are approximate. They do not replace Image MetaHub's deterministic search across prompts, metadata, models, LoRAs, and workflows.

## Explore

Explore is the single discovery workspace that replaced the separate Model View, Smart Library, and Collections screens. It presents your library across three dimensions — **Models**, **Clusters**, and **Collections** — as browsable cards.

* **Scope drill-in**: opening a card scopes the Library grid to it and shows the scope as a dedicated chip in Active Filters, so it stays combinable with every other filter instead of trapping you in a separate screen
* **Prompt clustering**: a background worker groups related images by prompt similarity
* **TF-IDF auto-tags**: generate useful tags from prompts, models, LoRAs, and workflow metadata
* **Stack browsing**: open a stack, paginate inside it, and keep navigation context in the image viewer
* **Deduplication helper**: rank likely keep/archive candidates and estimate space savings
* **Back button**: return from a drill-in scope straight to the matching Explore dimension
* **Free-tier limits**: the open-source app includes Explore workflows, while Pro removes clustering scale limits

Library-wide operations (automation rules, auto-tagging the library, analytics) live in the Library Tools menu in the library toolbar.

### Classic Mode

If you prefer the previous navigation, **Settings → Appearance → Classic Mode** restores the old Model View / Smart Library / Collections / Node View labels as shortcuts that deep-link into Explore.

## ComfyUI Nodes Filter

The standalone Node View has been retired in favor of a multi-select **ComfyUI Nodes** filter in the sidebar's Generation Parameters, for libraries with embedded ComfyUI workflows:

* Search exact node-type names across the current scope
* Multi-select node filters with OR matching
* See per-node result counts before applying a filter
* Combine node filters with every other filter and the active scope, without leaving the library grid

## Metadata Support

Image MetaHub reads metadata from:

* Stable Diffusion / Automatic1111 images
* ComfyUI workflows and prompt graphs
* InvokeAI
* SD.Next
* Forge
* Fooocus
* SwarmUI
* Draw Things
* Midjourney / Niji Journey
* Adobe Firefly
* DreamStudio
* DALL-E
* Other tools that embed generation parameters into PNG/JPEG/WebP/AVIF metadata or sidecar payloads

Supported media types:

* **Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP, AVIF, GIF
* **Video**: MP4, WEBM, MKV, MOV, AVI
* **Audio**: MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, OGA, M4A, AAC, OPUS, AIFF, AIF, WMA

For video and audio metadata, Image MetaHub uses container metadata plus `ffprobe` when available to extract duration, codec, frame count, resolution, sample rate, channels, and bit rate. Audio files can be indexed even when a codec is not playable by Chromium/Electron on the current system.

### AVIF metadata

Image MetaHub reads ComfyUI prompt and workflow documents from standard AVIF XMP items, including files produced by the proposed ComfyUI AVIF saver and frontend loader. It also reads the older EXIF convention used by existing ComfyUI AVIF files.

New Image MetaHub AVIF exports are intentionally compact: the full prompt and workflow graphs stay in their established ComfyUI XMP fields rather than being copied again. The Image MetaHub namespace stores app-specific fields (tags, notes, attribution, analytics, lineage, source generator) alongside the extracted parameter snapshot (model, seed, steps, cfg, sampler, scheduler, negative prompt) the Save Node records — those structured fields are kept because re-deriving them from arbitrary custom-node graphs is unreliable. When a legacy nested prompt conflicts with a standalone XMP prompt, the standalone document wins and the viewer shows a metadata-conflict badge.

### Civitai links (opt-in)

Model and LoRA hashes in the Image Modal are clickable and open the matching Civitai page. The lookup only happens when you click — a single request to Civitai's public API, cached locally so each hash is looked up at most once. It works with A1111, Forge, SD.Next, and Fooocus images, plus ComfyUI images saved with the MetaHub Save Node, and can be disabled entirely under **Settings → Privacy**. Indexing and browsing stay fully offline either way.

### MetaHub Save Node

For ComfyUI, the best experience comes from the companion [ImageMetaHub Save Node](https://github.com/LuqP2/ImageMetaHub-ComfyUI-Save) on the [ComfyUI Registry](https://registry.comfy.org/publishers/image-metahub/nodes/imagemetahub-comfyui-save).

With the Save Node, Image MetaHub can ingest:

* Full workflow and prompt payloads
* Tags and notes saved by the workflow
* GPU and timing analytics
* Explicit lineage metadata for derived images

For older ComfyUI images without the node, Image MetaHub still attempts best-effort parsing from embedded workflow data.

![Image details and metadata](assets/screenshot-imagemodal.webp)

## Image Lineage and Viewer

The image viewer is no longer just a single modal. In the current app it supports:

* Multiple open image windows at the same time
* Move, resize, minimize, maximize, and focus management
* Docked or collapsed detail panels
* Lineage display for transformations like `img2img`, `inpaint`, and `outpaint`, including generation-type and denoise context when available
* Source-image recovery from explicit references or inferred metadata when possible
* Derived-image previews to navigate transformation chains

## Automatic1111 Integration (Pro)

With Pro enabled, Image MetaHub can talk directly to a running Automatic1111 instance.

Main workflows:

* **Copy to A1111**: format metadata into A1111's three-line parameter block for the blue-arrow import flow
* **Generate with A1111**: send normalized metadata directly to the API for quick regeneration
* **Model and LoRA selection**: browse available models/LoRAs and override prompt parameters before generation
* **Queue-aware progress**: generations feed the shared queue and progress surfaces

Basic setup:

1. Start A1111 with `--api`.
2. If needed, allow the app origin with `--cors-allow-origins=http://localhost:5173`.
3. Configure the server URL in Image MetaHub settings.

## ComfyUI Integration (Pro)

With Pro enabled, Image MetaHub can generate through ComfyUI using either the original embedded workflow or a safe metadata rebuild.

The ComfyUI Workspace adds a full working area around a running local ComfyUI instance: an embedded browser, selected-image context, library thumbnails, directory scoping, workflow/raw metadata tabs, copy/generate actions, and direct routes from the grid, table, toolbar, and image viewer. In the browser build, the same entry points open ComfyUI externally instead of embedding it.

**Current flow:**

1. Open an image with compatible metadata.
2. Click `Generate with ComfyUI`.
3. Choose `Original workflow` or `Simple rebuild`.
4. Adjust prompt, negative prompt, seed, steps, CFG, dimensions, model overrides, LoRAs, and source image policy when relevant.
5. Optionally use the visual workflow editor or advanced JSON editor.
6. Queue the workflow to ComfyUI and follow progress in real time over WebSocket.

**What exists today:**

* **Workflow-native mode** for executable embedded prompt graphs
* **Simple rebuild mode** for metadata-only images
* **Visual workflow inspector/editor** with pan/zoom and per-node field editing
* **Embedded ComfyUI Workspace** for staying inside Image MetaHub while browsing source images and working in ComfyUI
* **Model-family aware overrides** for checkpoints, UNETs, VAEs, CLIP loaders, and LoRAs when supported
* **Transform-aware source image policies** for img2img/inpaint-style workflows
* **Shared queue** with retry, cancel, cleanup actions, and optional detection of ComfyUI jobs started outside Image MetaHub
* **Live generation preview** in the queue, updating step-by-step during generation for jobs started from MetaHub *and* from the embedded ComfyUI UI, with a resizable preview box that remembers its height
* **Run current workflow** straight from the queue, queueing whatever workflow is loaded in the embedded ComfyUI workspace
* **Metadata-rich outputs** when used with the MetaHub Save Node and Timer node

**Setup:**

1. Run ComfyUI locally, usually on `http://127.0.0.1:8188`.
2. Install the MetaHub Save Node.
3. Configure the ComfyUI URL in settings.
4. Optionally save a local launch command so the desktop header can start or reopen ComfyUI for you.
5. Test the connection from the app and start generating.

## Compare View (Pro)

Image MetaHub currently supports comparing **up to 4 images** with:

* Side-by-side mode with optional synchronized zoom/pan
* Side Strip and 2x2 Grid layouts for 3-4 image sets
* Slider, hover, flicker, difference map, loupe, and edge modes for two-image comparisons
* Metadata comparison in standard or diff view, with all panels expanding, collapsing, and scrolling in sync
* Quick swap and keyboard shortcuts

![Compare panel](assets/screenshot-compare.webp)

## Analytics (Pro)

The Analytics Explorer summarizes library usage and generation performance:

* `Overview`, `Resources`, `Time`, `Performance`, and `Curation` views
* Scope switching between the current filtered results and the full library
* Cohort comparisons for generators, models, LoRAs, samplers, GPU devices, ratings, and more
* One-click promotion of analytics insights into live filters
* Average speed, VRAM, and generation time for MetaHub Save Node images
* Performance charts grouped over time or by GPU

![Analytics dashboard](assets/screenshot-analytics.webp)

## Development

This repository contains the desktop app source code.

**Stack:**

* React 18 + TypeScript
* Electron
* Zustand
* Vite
* Tailwind CSS
* Vitest

**Common commands:**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run dev:app
npm run build
npm run electron-dist
npm run test
npm run lint
```

**CLI helpers:**

```bash
npm run cli:parse -- path/to/file.png --pretty --raw
npm run cli:index -- path/to/folder --out index.jsonl --recursive
```

For release work, see [RELEASE-GUIDE.md](RELEASE-GUIDE.md) and [RELEASE-AUTOMATION.md](RELEASE-AUTOMATION.md).

## Troubleshooting

On macOS, if audio or video playback crashes the Electron Helper, quit Image MetaHub first, then launch it from Terminal with the opt-in media safe mode:

```bash
IMH_MEDIA_SAFE_MODE=1 /Applications/Image\ MetaHub.app/Contents/MacOS/Image\ MetaHub
```

To confirm the flag was applied, `process-events.log` should include `mediaSafeModeEnabled: true` in the `app-startup` entry. This disables hardware acceleration plus accelerated video decode/compositing switches for that launch only. The lower-level `IMH_DISABLE_GPU=1` flag is also available when you want to test GPU acceleration separately.

## Privacy

Image MetaHub is designed to stay local:

* Your files, cache, tags, and metadata stay on your machine.
* There is no required account system.
* Pro licenses are validated offline.
* Network activity is limited to things that explicitly need it, such as:
  * auto-update checks
  * local A1111 / ComfyUI APIs
  * Civitai hash lookups you explicitly click (can be disabled in Settings → Privacy)
  * links you choose to open
