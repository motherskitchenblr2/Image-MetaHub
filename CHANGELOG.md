# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.19.3] - [09-12-2026]

### Added

- **Prompt Library**: Save prompts from your library into a dedicated collection, then search, sort, copy, remove, or jump back to the source image. Random lets you rediscover saved prompts with their positive and negative text and source preview.
- **Image Provenance**: Added a read-only provenance view for inspecting available source and lineage information, with on-demand SHA-256 fingerprinting and copyable provenance summaries.

### Improved

- **Image Viewer Navigation**: Arrow-key navigation is more responsive, with better neighboring-image preloading and smoother browsing while moving quickly through images.
- **Viewer Zoom**: Choose Fit or 1:1 as the default image zoom. Images configured for 1:1 open directly at their native zoom, and mouse-wheel zoom uses more consistent increments.
- **ComfyUI Workspace Navigation**: Viewer navigation from the ComfyUI workspace follows the workspace's newest-first order independently from the main Library sort and stays current as new images arrive.
- **Library Startup and Refreshing**: Library caches remain valid across launches when their parser version matches, while startup enrichment and background refreshes perform fewer unnecessary recomputations.
- **Thumbnail Loading**: Failed thumbnail decodes are cached for the current file version, avoiding repeated decode attempts while browsing.

### Fixed

- **ComfyUI Krea2 Workflows**: Prompt, negative prompt, and LoRA extraction follows the executed Krea2 workflow route, including grounded encode nodes and switch-based workflows.
- **Detached Viewer on macOS**: Packaged viewer windows load application paths containing spaces or Unicode characters correctly.
- **3D Model Preview**: Switching between 3D models recreates the preview for the currently selected item.
- **Library Cache Persistence**: Compatible parser caches are reused on subsequent launches instead of triggering a full library reindex.
- **ComfyUI Workspace Thumbnails**: Single-clicking a thumbnail opens it in the workspace inspector, while double-clicking or pressing Enter opens the configured full viewer and keeps the workspace active.
- **Detached Viewer Deletion**: Deleting the current image advances directly to the next available image in the same viewer window.
- **Image Grid Deletion**: The image-grid context menu includes Delete, applying to the clicked image or the current multi-selection.
- **Light Mode and Viewer Themes**: Text, headings, surfaces, and viewer actions maintain appropriate contrast across Light, Dark, Dracula, Nord, and Ocean themes.

## [0.19.2] - [2026-08-27]

### Improved

- **Bundled Dependencies**: Updated bundled dependencies with the available non-breaking security fixes while keeping the current Electron version unchanged.
- **Viewer Theme Consistency**: Improved Light Mode contrast and visual hierarchy across the Image Modal, Image Preview sidebar, main sidebar, and Support / License settings, with clearer A1111 and ComfyUI actions and theme-aware surfaces for Dark, Dracula, Nord, and Ocean.

### Fixed

- **ComfyUI Workspace Thumbnails**: Single-clicking a thumbnail now opens it in the workspace inspector, while double-clicking or pressing Enter opens the full image viewer according to the configured inline or detached viewer setting without returning to the Library grid.
- **Detached Viewer Deletion**: Deleting the current image now advances to the next available image without closing, flashing, or reopening the detached viewer window.
- **Image Grid Deletion**: Added a Delete action to the image grid context menu, applying to the clicked image or the current multi-selection.
- **Light Mode Image Preview**: The preview title, file name, and metadata section headings now remain readable against the preview panel when using Light Mode.

## [0.19.1] - [2026-08-26]

### Added

- **Stripe Billing for Pro Plans**: Added production billing support for Monthly, Annual, and Lifetime purchases through Stripe, with automatic license provisioning and email delivery.
- **Subscription License Lifecycle**: Monthly and Annual licenses now follow their paid-through period automatically. Renewals extend access from paid invoices, while cancellations or payment failures do not cut off time that has already been paid for.
- **Refund Handling**: Full refunds now automatically revoke affected Lifetime purchases or the matching paid subscription period, with safe recovery when a refund later fails or is reversed.

### Improved

- **Playback Controls**: Repeat modes now show their current Off, All, or 1 state directly in the player.
- **License Delivery Reliability**: Stripe events and license emails are processed idempotently with durable retries and recovery safeguards, reducing the risk of duplicate licenses, duplicate delivery, or out-of-order billing events changing entitlement incorrectly.

### Fixed

- **Detached Viewer on macOS**: Separate viewer windows now load packaged file paths containing spaces or Unicode correctly.
- **Viewer Navigation After Deletion**: Deleting the current file now advances to the next available item even if the active filter or scope changed while the viewer was open, including in detached viewer windows.
- **3D Viewing**: Switching models no longer lets stale WebGL cleanup clear the active viewer, controls remain accessible outside the model viewport, errors stay readable, and OBJ/GLTF/FBX cards use stable placeholders instead of starting WebGL previews in the grid.
- **Startup Library State**: The library no longer flashes a false “no images match” state while its initial data is loading.
- **Krea2 Prompts**: MetaHub Save Node payloads containing `False` now recover the actual prompt from the embedded ComfyUI workflow.

## [0.19.0] - [2026-08-20]

### Added

- **Find Similar — Local Visual Search**: Added opt-in, fully local visual similarity search, including for images without generation metadata. Model download is a separate explicit action; indexing is resumable, supports optional WebGPU acceleration with WASM fallback, and covers the 2,000 newest images on Free or the full library on Pro. Experimental text-to-image queries remain separate from deterministic metadata search.
- **3D Model Library**: Added initial support for indexing, filtering, thumbnailing, viewing, and exporting GLB, GLTF, OBJ, FBX, and STL models, with Image MetaHub sidecars for formats that cannot embed the metadata.
- **Native Viewer Windows**: Images can now open in separate desktop windows with always-on-top, drag-and-drop, navigation, editing, metadata, and generation actions. Settings → Viewer → Behavior can restore the legacy in-app viewer.

### Improved

- **Portable Windows Build**: Added a dedicated Portable executable that keeps settings and caches beside the app, separate from the standard Windows installation.
- **License Activation**: Pro activation now uses signed IMH2 certificates verified by the desktop app, while lifetime licenses remain usable offline after activation. Historical license keys require a reissued IMH2 key.

### Fixed

- **Dates on Network Shares**: Files on SMB/CIFS shares no longer appear as December 31, 1969 when creation time is unavailable. Sorting, grouping, and the viewer now fall back to modification time, and existing cached entries are corrected on load.
- **Desktop File Actions**: Restored direct Show in Folder actions, preserved original timestamps when copying or moving files, and added an explicitly confirmed permanent-delete fallback when the Recycle Bin is unavailable.
- **ComfyUI EXIF Metadata**: JPEG and WebP exports with canonical ComfyUI workflow/prompt data are no longer misidentified as A1111 when a `parameters` field is also present, while empty graphs now fall through to `UserComment` and `Parameters` metadata.
- **Packaged MP4 Metadata**: Restored basic MP4 dimensions and duration when `ffprobe` is unavailable in the packaged app.
- **CLI Metadata Parsing**: Restored CLI parsing after the metadata engine's module boundary caused ESM/CJS loading failures.
- **Card View Preview**: Opening the preview sidebar no longer moves the focused card out of view when the grid reflows.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- **Auto-play Toggle**: A new Settings → Viewer → Playback option controls whether videos and audio start playing as soon as they open. It stays on by default; turning it off means the media viewer waits for you to press Play, both when opening a file and when moving to another one with the navigation arrows.
- **Repeat Modes and Shuffle**: The video player now supports three repeat modes (off, repeat all, repeat one) plus shuffle playback. Like VLC, repeat controls whether playback continues, while shuffle controls the playback order. Both settings are remembered, and slideshows are unaffected.

### Improved

- **Deleting Images**: Deleting one file could freeze the app for ~25 seconds on a large ComfyUI library, and the grid and viewer stayed unresponsive the whole time. Deleting now takes a fraction of a second on the same library, and no longer gets slower as the library grows: the folder cache is no longer rewritten around the removed entry, which is instead marked as gone and cleared out for good in a single pass once enough images have been deleted, or the next time the folder is reindexed. Cache chunks are also capped by size instead of only by entry count.
- **Cache File Size**: Cached entries no longer duplicate large raw metadata alongside its parsed form; the full text is re-read from the file when you open the metadata or workflow views. Applies as folders are reindexed.
- **New Images While Watching a Folder**: Adding, removing or enriching images no longer re-runs the whole filter and sort pipeline per event, so generating into a watched folder doesn't drop frames or block scrolling.
- **Search Responsiveness**: Search text is computed once per image and reused instead of rebuilt on every keystroke.
- **Image Lineage Rebuilds**: Lineage is no longer written to disk mid-interaction — rebuilds are coalesced and saved once things go quiet.
- **Viewer Navigation**: Moving between images in the viewer no longer flashes a low-resolution thumbnail or a loading placeholder before the full image lands. The neighbouring images — two ahead in the direction you're browsing, one behind — are now read and fully decoded in the background while you look at the current one, so stepping onto them is immediate. The viewer previously only worked out a neighbour's file path in advance, which left the actual read and decode to happen at the moment you pressed the key. Holding an arrow key still scrubs through previews, and any image that hasn't been prepared yet behaves as before.

### Fixed

- **Video Controls Click Targets**: Fixed the play/pause, mute, volume and loop controls near the edges of the video player triggering next/previous navigation instead of their own action, because the navigation hover zones painted on top of them.
- **Copy Metadata to Clipboard**: Fixed "Failed to copy..." errors on Copy Prompt, Copy Negative Prompt, Copy to A1111/ComfyUI and other clipboard actions that could occur after clearing the library cache or reindexing a folder, until the app was restarted. Text copies now go through Electron's native clipboard API, the same way image copies already did, instead of the browser API that could lose focus after a reload.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-07-21
 
### Added
 
- **Unified Explore Surface**: Model View, Smart Library and Collections are replaced by a single Explore workspace with Models / Clusters / Collections dimensions and card-based drill-in. Opening a card scopes the Library grid to it, shown as a dedicated chip in Active Filters that stays combinable with every other filter.
- **Classic Mode**: A new Settings → Appearance toggle restores the old Model View / Smart Library / Collections / Node View labels as shortcuts into Explore, for anyone who prefers the previous navigation.
- **ComfyUI Nodes Filter**: Node View is retired in favor of a multi-select "ComfyUI Nodes" filter in the sidebar's Generation Parameters, combinable with every other filter and the active scope instead of being a separate screen.
- **Header Tools Menu**: Automation rules and Auto-tag library moved into a new header "Tools" menu, since they're library-wide operations rather than tied to a specific collection or cluster.
- **Live Generation Preview**: The Queue now shows a live, KSampler-style preview image that updates step-by-step during ComfyUI generation — both for generations started from MetaHub's own workspace and from the embedded ComfyUI UI. The preview/output image box can be dragged taller for portrait images, and the size is remembered across sessions.
- **Run Current Workflow**: Added a "Run" button to the top of the Queue that queues whatever workflow is currently loaded in the embedded ComfyUI workspace, so you can trigger a generation from anywhere in the app.
- **First-Class AVIF Metadata**: Added AVIF discovery, Chromium-backed previews and thumbnails, dimensions, ComfyUI XMP prompt/workflow parsing, legacy AVIF EXIF compatibility, CLI parsing, bounded full-file fallback for late XMP, metadata stripping, and metadata-preserving AVIF export. Exports keep the full prompt and workflow graph in standard ComfyUI XMP fields, while MetaHub's own tags, notes, attribution and an extracted parameter snapshot (model, seed, steps, cfg, sampler, scheduler, negative prompt) live in a compact private extension. Thanks to @austintraver.

### Improved
 
- **Group By Model/Cluster**: Sort Order and Group By moved from the sidebar to the persistent grid footer, with new Group By options for checkpoint model and cluster.
- **Reparse Metadata Performance**: "Reparse Metadata" no longer rewrites the entire folder cache for a single image, so it stays fast regardless of library size. It patches only the cache chunk(s) that hold the reparsed images instead of re-serializing every entry, and uses a persistent id→chunk index to read just the target chunk directly rather than scanning the whole cache — a big win on large ComfyUI libraries where each chunk can be tens of MB. The index is validated on every use and rebuilt automatically if the cache changed, so it never serves stale data.
- **Compare Mode Metadata Panels**: Metadata panels in Compare now expand and collapse together and scroll in sync, so one click reveals every image's metadata. Simplified the Standard/Diff toggle and fixed the Flicker view mode, which was rendering both images stacked instead of alternating.
- **Library Toolbar**: Added a Back button that returns to the matching Explore dimension from a drill-in scope, and moved the Library Tools menu and Analytics button out of the global header into the library toolbar.
### Fixed
 
- **A1111 Sampler/Schedule Parsing**: Fixed the Sampler value being written to the Schedule field instead of Sampler, which left the Generation Details pane showing the sampler name under the wrong heading.
- **Group By Navigation**: Fixed the Group By date/session calendar getting stuck on the active month, and Jump to Group requiring two clicks to scroll correctly on the first try.
- **Light Theme Contrast**: Fixed accent-colored text that stayed light in the light theme and washed out — the update dialog's download-error message, the active Settings navigation item, and the startup-verification info box are now readable. These colors were hardcoded for the dark themes; a dedicated light-theme override keeps the dark, Dracula, Nord and Ocean themes unchanged.
- **ComfyUI Workspace Folder Selector**: The folder dropdown in the thumbnail rail now gives its options an explicit background and text color, fixing folder names rendering as white-on-white in the native dropdown.


## [0.17.5] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **Civitai Links**: Model and LoRA hashes in the Image Modal are now clickable and open the matching Civitai page. The lookup happens only when you click — a single request to Civitai's public API, with the result cached locally so each hash is only ever looked up once. Works with A1111, Forge, SD.Next and Fooocus images, plus ComfyUI images saved with the MetaHub Save Node. Can be fully disabled under Settings → Privacy. Indexing and browsing remain 100% offline, as always.

### Fixed

- **Generator Detection Priority**: Reordered metadata parser dispatch so DreamStudio, Draw Things, Midjourney, Niji and Forge images are correctly identified instead of being swallowed by the generic Automatic1111 catch-all.
- **MetaHub Save Node Tags/Notes**: Tags and notes from MetaHub Save Node images are no longer dropped during metadata normalization.
- **Large Library Metadata Re-reads**: Files that overflowed the batch read budget are now re-read consistently, and truncated WebP metadata is detected and re-read the same way PNG already was.
- **Folder Tree Sorting**: Subfolders now sort case-insensitively and naturally (matching Finder/Windows Explorer) instead of raw filesystem order.
- **macOS External File Drag**: Dragging grid cards onto ComfyUI or into Finder on macOS now transfers the actual file instead of a text clipping.

## [0.17.4] - 2026-07-11

### Improved

- **Create New Folder in Move/Copy**: Added a "Create New Folder" option to the Move/Copy To panel, with folder-tree navigation for picking or creating the destination.
- **ComfyUI Workspace Drag & Drop**: Added drag-and-drop for bringing images into the ComfyUI workspace.
- **ComfyUI Workflow Tools**: Simplified the Image Modal workflow experience around the embedded original workflow, combining parameters with the visual graph, adding a dedicated node list with editable parameters, and a metadata-only workflow option.
- **ComfyUI Workflow Preview**: Enlarged the visual workflow canvas with an expandable view, opaque node cards, collision-aware positioning, draggable node arrangement, and a clear Restore Layout action.
- **Filter Recovery**: Added a clearer empty state when filters return no images, with convenient Clear All actions beside active filters and in the results area.
- **Accessibility and UI Feedback**: Improved visible keyboard focus and tactile feedback across toolbar, search, modal, facet filter, rating, pagination, view, and queue controls, added copy-confirmation feedback in the Image Modal and Image Card, a keyboard shortcut hint in the search bar, and keyboard access for the ComfyUI metadata toggle.
- **Large Library Performance**: Reduced temporary allocations and repeated processing across analytics, prompt similarity, Smart Library clustering, the search/filter worker, image grouping and stacking, path filtering, and the image store.

### Fixed

- **Collections Grouping**: Fixed Group By inside open Collections so date, name, and generation-session grouping work in both grid and table views, including Jump To navigation.
- **ComfyUI Metadata Truncation**: Fixed metadata loss for large embedded ComfyUI workflows in PNG files by re-reading the full file when a head-read truncates metadata chunks.
- **Checkpoint Facets**: Fixed checkpoint facets so they stay scoped to the current library.
- **Folder Filters**: Fixed folder filters so they derive correctly from the selected directory prefix.
- **macOS Audio Playback**: Fixed macOS audio playback mitigation for embedded media.

## [0.17.3] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Creator Attribution**: Added Image MetaHub creator attribution support from embedded metadata, including persisted attribution tokens and attribution-aware Pro/license checkout links.
- **Delete Confirmation Option**: Added a Viewer setting to skip delete confirmations for faster cleanup workflows.

### Improved

- **MetaHub Save Node Metadata**: Improved parsing for MetaHub-generated PNG, JPEG, WebP, and video metadata, preserving attribution, analytics, Pro payloads, generation type, lineage, LoRAs, and recovered workflow details.
- **ComfyUI Workflow Parsing**: Improved extraction for subgraph-backed ComfyUI workflows, grouped Flux workflows, Ideogram 4 scheduler flows, rgthree/LoraManager LoRA nodes, text joiners, guiders, schedulers, switches, and muted-node handling.
- **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary intermediate array allocations across analytics, file indexing, library filtering, automation rules, similar-image search, and cache-heavy paths to improve responsiveness on large libraries.
- **Accessibility**: Improved keyboard and screen reader accessibility across comparison controls, changelog buttons, settings controls, and modal/navigation focus states.
- **Find Similar Matching**: Improved similar-image matching with normalized prompts, LoRA weight handling, checkpoint and folder scoping, better result scoring, and model/prompt overlap grouping.
- **Cache Delta Reliability**: Improved chunked cache delta writes with serialized updates, safer payload sanitization, fallback cache creation, and pruning by both image id and relative path.

### Fixed

- **Open Generated Image Deep Link**: The MetaHub Save Node deep link now adds the containing folder to the Directory List, indexes only the generated file, and opens it directly instead of scanning the entire output folder.
- **Watched Folder Removals**: Fixed watched-file removal handling so UI state, open modals, selection, comparison, and cache entries stay in sync after files are deleted.
- **Generation Queue Controls**: Fixed the Clear Finished button state so it is disabled and clearly explained when there are no finished items to clear.

## [0.17.2] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **ComfyUI Workspace Reloads**: Fixed embedded ComfyUI reload behavior so failed or hidden views can reopen the configured ComfyUI URL correctly.
- **ComfyUI Workflow Loading**: Fixed stale workflow load requests that could be reused after already being handled.
- **Watched Folder Deletions**: Improved deletion handling for auto-watched folders so removed files are reconciled through the watcher instead of being removed twice.
- **Cache Delta Updates**: Improved cache delta writes after watched file removals and added safer retry handling when replacing cache chunks.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Ideogram v4 Metadata Support**: Added ComfyUI parser support for Ideogram v4 / KJ prompt-builder workflows, including subgraph-prefixed nodes, prompt reconstruction, model/VAE, CFG, scheduler, sampler, steps, and seed extraction.
- **Desktop Deep Links**: Added `imagemetahub://` protocol handling so the desktop app can open folders from deep links, CLI directory arguments, and second-instance launches.
- **Rating Hotkeys**: Added 1–5 keyboard shortcuts for quickly applying ratings to the active image or current selection.

### Improved

- **Find Similar Workflow**: Improved Find Similar with a minimum prompt similarity slider, result-set filtering, scoped result navigation, and a smoother inspect-results flow.
- **Large Library Performance**: Reduced temporary array, map, and set allocations across collections, file sync, image editing, and large ComfyUI workflow rendering.
- **Accessibility**: Added clearer labels, titles, and decorative SVG handling across filter controls, the image editor, hotkey help, and browser compatibility surfaces.
- **Update Notifications**: Replaced the native update dialog with a cleaner in-app update modal that shows release notes, download progress, and clear install options. 

### Fixed

- **Find Similar Modal Layout**: Fixed footer visibility, sidebar scrolling, and long checkpoint/LoRA text overflow in Find Similar results.
- **What's New Modal**: Fixed a startup race that could cause the “What’s New” modal to reopen on every launch after the current version had already been viewed.
- **Version on UI**: Corrected versioning on Folder Selection screen.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Expanded Compare View**: Added new two-image comparison modes, including slider, hover, flicker, difference map, loupe, and edge comparison.
- **Built-in Image Editor**: Added a new local image editor for still images, with adjustments, crop, rotate, flip, resize, sharpen, blur, annotations, text, highlights, blur/pixelate regions, undo/redo, zoom, Save As, and Overwrite.


### Improved

- **Image Editing Tools**: Expanded the previous adjustment panel into a fuller editing workflow with separate controls for adjustments, crop, transform, resize, and enhance tools.
- **Performance and Responsiveness**: Improved responsiveness in large libraries, faster image viewer navigation, and reduced UI slowdowns during cache updates, file watching, and rapid browsing.
- **Image Viewer Navigation**: Improved rapid left/right navigation in the image viewer, especially when holding arrow keys through large folders.
- **Image Viewer Zoom**: Improved fit/actual-size zoom behavior and zoom limits in the image viewer.
- **ComfyUI Metadata Parsing**: Improved metadata extraction from ComfyUI workflows, including better support for additional node patterns and workflow graph structures.
- **Edited Image Saving**: Improved Save As and Overwrite behavior for edited images so saved files are refreshed in the library more reliably.
- **Media Playback Diagnostics**: Improved audio/video playback diagnostics to help identify desktop media playback issues.
- **Accessibility**: Added more accessible labels and control descriptions across icon-only buttons and editor/viewer controls.

### Fixed

- **Watched File Deletions**: Fixed watched file deletions so removed files are cleared from library cache more reliably without blocking the app.
- **Image Viewer Performance**: Fixed slowdowns caused by heavy sidebar updates during fast image navigation.
- **Edited Image Metadata**: Fixed edited image saves so generated PNGs carry updated output size and edit information more consistently.
- **Video Metadata Parsing**: Improved validation for MetaHub video metadata so invalid fallback metadata is no longer treated as a prompt.
- **ComfyUI Seed Parsing**: Fixed explicit ComfyUI seed `0` values being treated as missing in some metadata parsing paths.

## [0.16.1] - [2026-05-23]

### Added

- **Image Library Grouping**: Added Library Group By separators for date, name, and inferred generation sessions, plus Jump To navigation with calendar badges for date/session groups and representative thumbnails.
- **ComfyUI Workflow Actions**: Added richer ComfyUI workflow entry points across the main app, image viewer, grid, and embedded workspace, including workflow action coverage and desktop IPC support for workspace preview behavior.
- **ComfyUI Workspace Metadata Copying**: Added copy actions for workspace metadata fields and clearer image dimension display in the ComfyUI Workspace context panel.
- **Media Playback Diagnostics**: Added audio/video playback event diagnostics and imh-media protocol logging to help investigate early Electron Helper crashes on macOS.

### Improved

- **Large Library Performance**: Reduced temporary allocations and queue overhead in large libraries by avoiding `Array.shift()` hot paths, removing intermediate arrays during `Set`/`Map` construction, and optimizing lookup map initialization across store, thumbnail, lineage, and automation flows.
- **ComfyUI Visual Workflow Performance**: Reworked visual workflow graph depth calculation to avoid recursive stack overflows on long workflows and reduced object iteration overhead for large ComfyUI graphs.
- **Edited PNG Metadata Preservation**: Improved edited PNG saves so ComfyUI workflow metadata is preserved when image adjustment exports write PNG bytes.
- **Workspace Bulk Action UX**: Added clearer disabled-state tooltips for ComfyUI Workspace bulk actions so users can tell what selection is required.
- **Accessibility**: Added missing accessible labels to icon-only controls across the ComfyUI Workspace, directory list, preview/sidebar, image viewer, automation rules, sidebar, and batch export surfaces.
- **Hotkey Reset Safety**: Added a confirmation dialog before resetting all custom hotkeys.
- **macOS Media Safe Mode**: Documented the opt-in `IMH_MEDIA_SAFE_MODE=1` launch mode for testing GPU-related media playback crashes without affecting normal launches.

### Fixed

- **Grid Selection Behavior**: Improved multi-selection anchoring for Cmd/Ctrl-click and Shift-click, ignored stale selection anchors, and added toolbar support for clearing grid selections.
- **Adjustment Discovery**: Made image adjustments easier to find from the image details panel.
- **Bulk Favorite Behavior**: Fixed mixed favorite selections so the toolbar applies a deterministic all-favorite or all-unfavorite state instead of toggling each item independently.
- **ComfyUI Queue Monitor Loop**: Fixed repeated ComfyUI status updates causing queue monitor update loops.
- **ComfyUI Visual Workflow Upstreams**: Fixed visual workflow handling for missing upstream nodes.
- **Bulk Delete Shortcut Handling**: Fixed duplicate confirmation dialogs and repeated delete attempts when deleting selected images with the Delete key.
- **ComfyUI Workspace Prompt Selection**: Fixed the workspace image preview metadata panel so selecting prompt text no longer collapses the expanded parameters box.
- **Jump To Group Preview State**: Fixed stale hover previews from reappearing when reopening the Jump To Group menu after selecting a group or closing the menu.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Image Adjustment Editing**: Added an adjustment panel in the Image Modal for brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue, with desktop Save As and Overwrite workflows that export PNG output while preserving generation metadata.
- **Embedded ComfyUI Workspace**: Added a dedicated ComfyUI Workspace view with an embedded ComfyUI browser, image context panel, workflow metadata tabs, thumbnail navigation, copy/generate actions, and direct open actions from grid/table image contexts.
- **ComfyUI Queue Detection**: Added optional monitoring for ComfyUI jobs started outside Image MetaHub, showing waiting/processing/done/failed status, progress, output previews, and cancel support in the generation queue.

### Improved

- **Large Library Memory Usage**: Reduced OOM risk in large ComfyUI libraries by compacting oversized raw metadata, streaming cache diffing across chunks, using lighter Electron file handles, increasing renderer heap headroom, and avoiding automatic table thumbnails in very large result sets.
- **Large Library Cache Reconciliation**: Improved startup and manual cache checks for large folders by applying lightweight UI deltas and persisting chunked cache updates without rehydrating the entire library.
- **Cache Controls**: Clarified cache reset actions and added library cache clearing support from settings.
- **Trial Migration**: Reset eligible non-Pro trial state for this release so users affected by earlier trial behavior can start fresh.
- **Accessibility**: Added accessible labels to search, compare zoom controls, reset zoom, and generate variation icon-only controls.

### Fixed

- **macOS Keyboard Navigation**: Fixed Page Up/Page Down navigation in the image grid and kept folder tree keyboard navigation scrolled to the focused folder.
- **What's New Persistence**: Fixed the changelog splash screen reopening on every launch after the current version had already been viewed.
- **Video Viewer Scaling**: Fixed video sizing in the Image Modal so portrait and landscape videos fit the available viewer area without cropping playback controls.
- **Smart Library Cluster Persistence**: Fixed Smart Library cluster restore so cached stacks persist across sessions.
- **Cache Version Reindexing**: Fixed stale parser-version cache summaries so app updates reparse invalid cached metadata instead of leaving outdated metadata or empty cached libraries.
- **Scoped Folder Refresh Cache Persistence**: Fixed scoped folder refreshes so cache updates preserve unrelated cached entries while correctly applying changed and deleted files.
- **Desktop Saved Image Indexing**: Fixed desktop file handling paths used when saved or overwritten images are indexed/reparsed, including more accurate file type handling for edited outputs.

## [0.15.4] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- **Advanced Folder Management**: Added directory tree view with subfolder navigation, drag-and-drop file transfers, directory renaming, and global hotkey support for clipboard operations.
- **Generated Output Preview**: Added a dedicated preview modal for completed generation queue results.

### Improved

- **Generation Queue**: Rebuilt queue execution and progress tracking for clearer A1111/ComfyUI status, FIFO scheduling, clickable results, thumbnails, and lower-memory previews.
- **Image Grid Navigation**: Improved keyboard navigation, focused image state, page-boundary handling, preview updates, and thumbnail warmup behavior.
- **ComfyUI Workflow Experience**: Improved workflow JSON resolution, dimension target detection, error display, workspace tab persistence, and image modal integration.
- **Slideshow Experience**: Improved slideshow exit behavior and covered it with focused tests.
- **Accessibility**: Added accessible labels to modal close buttons.

### Fixed

- **Maximum Update Depth Error**: Fixed a critical "Maximum update depth exceeded" error during heavy indexing. Stabilized array references in the application state to prevent infinite re-rendering loops when new batches of images are loaded.
- **Generation Queue Cancellation**: Fixed canceled A1111 and ComfyUI jobs blocking the queue, leaving stale artifacts, or clearing progress for the next job.
- **Folder Rename State**: Fixed directory rename edge cases including nested root remapping, folder filter preservation, and stale rename state.
- **Clipboard Paste Recovery**: Fixed failed folder paste operations so the clipboard contents are retained.
- **Image Grid Layout**: Fixed column count and transition issues that could make thumbnail navigation feel inconsistent.

## [0.15.3] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **React Hook Ordering in Preview/Viewer Navigation**: Fixed a React hooks violation in `ImagePreviewSidebar` that could turn the app black when changing the active preview image, opening thumbnails, or navigating the image viewer.
- **Arrow Key Event Propagation**: Enhanced arrow key navigation in `ImageModal` by preventing event propagation, resolving conflicts with other keyboard handlers that could interrupt navigation flow.

## [0.15.2] - 2026-04-24

### Improved

- **Thumbnail Loading Performance**: Refactored the desktop thumbnail pipeline so cached image thumbnails resolve through URL-backed disk cache hits instead of per-image binary IPC, Blob creation, and Object URL churn.
- **Thumbnail Cache Scheduling**: Added batched thumbnail cache resolution, manifest-backed cache lookup, visible-first scheduling, and main-process thumbnail generation for faster grid loading and better responsiveness in large folders.

### Fixed

- **Video Thumbnails in Grid**: Fixed video thumbnails being generated or resolved but not displayed in the grid, leaving videos stuck on placeholder tiles.
- **v0.15.1 Hotfix Follow-up**: Restored normal thumbnail loading behavior while keeping the media memory-safety protections that prevent large video/audio files from being read fully into renderer memory.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **Desktop Media Memory Safety**: Fixed a v0.15.0 regression where large video or audio files could be read fully into renderer memory when the desktop streaming media URL path failed, potentially causing black screens or renderer crashes on macOS.
- **Video Thumbnail Guardrails**: Reduced thumbnail generation concurrency, capped active thumbnail object URLs, reused legacy thumbnail cache entries where possible, and skipped renderer-side video thumbnail generation for videos with unknown size or over 80 MB to avoid memory spikes during cache refresh.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Automation Rules**: Added persistent rules that can automatically tag images and add them to collections based on searchable conditions, metadata facets, ratings, favorites, telemetry, prompts, filenames, dimensions, generators, and other library filters. Includes live previews, manual apply, duplication, enable/disable controls, and optional execution for newly indexed images.
- **Find Similar + Compare Flow**: Added a new `Find similar...` workflow in the grid, table, Image Modal, and Model View for finding prompt matches and related images across checkpoints, then sending the results directly into Compare Mode.
- **Slideshow Mode**: Added fullscreen slideshow playback for the current selection or active browse scope, with keyboard controls plus configurable interval and filename overlay settings.
- **Audio Library Support**: Added indexing, metadata extraction, filtering, library views, and in-app playback for common audio formats including MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG/OGA, M4A, AAC, OPUS, AIFF/AIF, and WMA.
- **Editable Metadata Workflow**: Added a metadata editor for normalized generation fields in the viewer, including prompt, negative prompt, model, resources/LoRAs, seed, steps, CFG, sampler, scheduler, dimensions, and notes, while keeping edits local and reversible through shadow metadata.

### Improved

- **Compare Mode Clarity**: Compare Mode now highlights the matching metadata panel based on hover position and opens with metadata collapsed by default for faster visual review.
- **Transparency-Aware Previews**: Grid thumbnails, table previews, sidebar previews, footer previews, and the Image Modal now preserve alpha channels consistently and display transparent images over a checkerboard background.
- **Windowed Viewer UX**: Floating image windows are more reliable around focus, activation, dragging, offscreen recovery, footer layering, sidebar resizing, and optional minimize/restore motion.
- **Selection and Navigation Scope**: Opening images from the grid, table, stacks, collections, or background-open actions now preserves multi-selection and keeps navigation tied to the active scope.
- **Tagging and Filtering Workflow**: Added clear buttons to facet searches, kept mixed-selection tags available in batch tagging, and allowed clicking existing batch-tag chips to apply that tag to the full selection.
- **Image Rename Workflows**: Added inline rename in the grid plus rename actions in grid/table context menus and the Image Modal, while preserving subfolders and original extensions.
- **Indexed Subfolder Transfers**: Bulk copy/move actions can now target indexed subfolders, including nested folders and symlinked or aliased destinations.
- **Unified Export Metadata Policies**: Added a shared export flow for single-image and batch export with metadata policies to preserve original metadata, strip metadata entirely, or save a standardized `Image MetaHub + A1111` compatible PNG copy.
- **Large Library Responsiveness**: Improved Smart Library clustering behavior and added optional performance diagnostics for troubleshooting search, grid, thumbnail, and viewer responsiveness.
- **Viewer Metadata Actions**: Image Modal and Image Preview Sidebar now share clearer entry points for editing metadata, exporting edited copies, exporting without metadata, and switching between original and edited metadata views.
- **Export Pipeline Consistency**: Unified desktop export handling behind a single request model so regular export, batch export, metadata stripping, and metadata rewrite all follow the same scope-aware workflow.

### Fixed

- **Library Watcher Refresh**: Moved or deleted files, removed watched folders, sidecar metadata updates, and refreshed audio/video files now sync more reliably without stale or duplicated entries.
- **Rename State Consistency**: Renamed images now keep selections, previews, detached modal references, annotations, collections, Smart Library clusters, and cached thumbnail state aligned to the new ID and path.
- **ComfyUI Wildcard Prompt Parsing**: Fixed `ImpactWildcardProcessor` handling so linked `populated_text` / `wildcard_text` inputs resolve correctly instead of being treated as literal prompt text.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **Collections**: Added a dedicated `Collections` tab for reusable image groups, with manual and tag-driven collections, multi-tag rules, ordering, cover images, collection cards, in-place settings, and collection actions across the grid, table, Image Modal, and toolbar, including saving or adding the current filtered result set.

### Improved

- **Unified Tag Entry UX**: Manual tag entry in `ImageModal`, `ImagePreviewSidebar`, and `Tag Manager` now shares the same suggestion combobox, keyboard navigation, mouse selection behavior, and match ranking, making tag suggestions feel consistent everywhere.
- **Tagging Controls in Settings**: Added viewer settings for tag suggestion count and visible recent-tag chips, while keeping a larger internal recent-tag history so quick picks stay useful without overwhelming the UI.
- **Safer Bulk Tag Suggestions**: The Tag Manager's comma-separated input now applies autocomplete only to the active CSV token, making multi-tag edits faster and less error-prone.
- **Viewer Annotation Layout**: Moved the star rating control above the tag editor in the full image view and preview sidebar so tags have more horizontal space.
- **Header and Navigation Polish**: Refreshed the header layout, aligned view navigation more cleanly, added Collections to the main view switcher, and reduced overlay issues around Settings and other top-level controls.
- **Stable Sidebar Layout**: Restored the single-scroll sidebar filter flow and tightened sidebar sizing so folder, tag, and filter browsing remains predictable.

### Fixed

- **License Persistence on Restart**: Fixed an Electron settings persistence regression where saving general app settings could overwrite the stored license block, causing Pro users to fall back to Free Mode after restart.
- **Live Collection Removal**: Fixed removing images from auto-updating tag collections so removed images stay excluded unless explicitly added back.
- **Collection Settings Conversion**: Fixed clearing Auto-Add Tags in Collection Settings so tag-rule collections keep their currently resolved images when converted to manual collections.
- **Frozen Collection Membership**: Fixed disabling auto-update on tag-driven collections so the frozen snapshot preserves the resolved, curated membership instead of reintroducing previously removed tag matches.
- **Manual Collection Counts**: Fixed manual collection membership and counts so deleted or unindexed images no longer remain in resolved collection results.
- **Collection Sort Ordering**: Fixed new collection ordering after deleted collections so sort indexes are allocated from the current maximum instead of reusing stale positions.
- **Filtered Collection Reordering**: Fixed collection move buttons while searching collections so they reflect the collection's global order instead of the filtered list position.
- **Tag Input Enter Behavior**: Fixed tag combobox Enter handling so typed tags submit as entered unless the user explicitly navigates to a suggestion first.
- **Search Field Hotkeys**: Fixed global hotkeys firing while typing in text inputs, preventing search text from being interrupted by app actions.
- **Preview Sidebar Opening Unexpectedly**: Fixed the Image Preview sidebar opening by itself after search/filter changes or view switches by limiting automatic preview restoration to active grid keyboard navigation.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Visual ComfyUI Workflow Inspector**: Added a visual node-based editor inside the ComfyUI generation modal and Image Details Modal, with zoom/pan controls, editable node fields, embedded-layout support, and an advanced JSON fallback for debugging edge cases.
- **ComfyUI Node View**: Added a dedicated `Node View` alongside Library, Smart Library, and Model View, with searchable exact node-type catalogs, per-node result counts, and multi-select OR filtering for images that contain embedded ComfyUI workflows.
- **Image Lineage for Transformations**: Added explicit lineage support for `img2img`, `inpaint`, and `outpaint`, so transformed images are no longer treated as generic generations. The viewer now shows the generation type, source/input image status, denoise strength when available, and direct navigation between source and result when the original image can be recovered with confidence.
- **Analytics Explorer**: Rebuilt analytics into an interactive explorer with `Overview`, `Resources`, `Time`, `Performance`, and `Curation` views, scope switching between the current results and full library, cohort comparison tools, and one-click promotion of analytics insights into live filters.
- **Windowed Image Viewer**: Added support for multiple open image windows with drag, resize, minimize/maximize, and dockable or collapsible details so images can be compared and inspected more flexibly.
- **Image Ratings**: Added persistent 1-5 ratings for images, including star controls in the viewer, badges in the library views, bulk rating actions, and multi-select rating filters in the sidebar and advanced filters.
- **Startup Verification Modes**: Added configurable startup verification modes for saved folders, so the app can now open from cache only, reconcile in the background, or verify folders strictly before startup completes.
- **Manual Tag Management**: Added a persistent manual tag catalog so empty tags remain visible in the sidebar, plus right-click tag actions for renaming, clearing tags from images, removing unused tags, and clearing/deleting used tags in one step.
- **Metadata Type Filters**: Added checkbox filters for `txt2img` / `img2img` generation modes and `Images` / `Videos` file types in `Metadata & File Filters`.
- **Manual Metadata Recovery**: Added `Reparse Metadata` actions for single images and multi-selection workflows, reprocessing only the chosen files and updating their cached metadata without requiring a full folder refresh or cache clear.
- **Expanded Compare View**: Added support for comparing up to 4 images at once, with new `Side Strip` and `2x2 Grid` layouts for 3-4 image sets, plus improved Compare integration with the windowed viewer workflow.

### Improved

- **Electron Privileged IPC Hardening**: Restricted renderer-driven write operations to app-internal paths or user-approved export destinations, tightened generator launch requests so they must match the saved integration settings, and limited test-only update dialog exposure to development builds.
- **Offline License Integrity**: Revalidated persisted Pro/Lifetime state on startup, removed the temporary "unlock during initialization" window for paid features, and limited the `IMH_DEV_LICENSE` shortcut to development builds only.
- **Background Worker Guardrails**: Added validation and sane limits for clustering and auto-tagging worker payloads so malformed or extreme jobs fail fast instead of consuming excessive CPU or memory.
- **ComfyUI Variation Controls**: Expanded the ComfyUI generation modal with workflow mode selection, model-family aware resource overrides, LoRA controls, source image policy for transform workflows, and better handling for original-graph assets.
- **Favorites Icon Refresh**: Updated favorite actions and indicators to use a heart icon instead of a star for clearer separation from the new rating system.
- **Sidebar Faceted Filters**: Reworked the sidebar filter experience around dedicated facet sections for checkpoints, LoRAs, samplers, and schedulers, with per-value include/exclude actions, result counts, in-section search, and clearer active-filter chips.
- **Tag Match Mode**: Added an `Any / All` toggle for included manual tag filters in the sidebar, allowing tag searches to match any selected tag or require all selected tags for narrower curation workflows.
- **Large Library Responsiveness**: Significantly improved responsiveness for large libraries by moving lineage resolution out of the image modal hot path, reducing expensive modal navigation lookups, and cutting renderer churn during indexing and filtering.
- **Cached Startup Stability**: Reduced reopen instability on large libraries and made startup verification less intrusive by default, improving launches from cache on heavy libraries.
- **Sidebar Visual Cohesion**: Simplified the sidebar styling into a more consistent, subdued visual system and made the `Generation Parameters` section collapsible like the other filter groups.
- **Resizable Side Panels**: The left filter sidebar, Image Preview sidebar, generation queue, and Image Details Modal sidebar can now be resized by dragging their edges, with widths preserved between sessions for a more adaptable workspace.
- **Generation Queue Compatibility**: Updated the existing generation queue to persist and retry the new workflow-native ComfyUI parameters, including workflow mode, source image policy, advanced JSON overrides, and mask inputs.
- **Cross-Generator Transformation Detection**: Improved metadata parsing for ComfyUI, Automatic1111, Forge, SD.Next, InvokeAI, and Draw Things to detect transformation workflows more reliably, preserve lineage references during indexing, and surface img2img-specific parameters in a normalized way.
- **Generator Faceting**: Added sampler-aware caching and filtering support so sampler and scheduler metadata can be browsed more accurately from the sidebar and advanced filters.
- **Analytics Cohorts & Coverage**: Analytics summaries now account for favorites, ratings, GPU devices, telemetry presence, and bucketed performance ranges more accurately, making curation and performance comparisons more useful on mixed libraries.
- **Task-Based Settings Navigation**: Reorganized the Settings modal into focused Library, Viewer, Integrations, Appearance, Privacy, and Shortcuts panels with sidebar navigation and compatibility for legacy deep links.
- **Lineage Fallback Clarity**: When a transformation is detected but the original image cannot be recovered with confidence, the UI now states that clearly instead of implying a weak or uncertain match.
- **Grid Filename Readability**: Thumbnail captions now support a two-line layout, making long filenames and full-path display more usable without requiring fullscreen zoom.
- **Copy Submenu in Grid Context Menu**: Grouped copy actions under a `Copy` submenu in the image grid, including prompt, negative prompt, seed, and checkpoint.
- **Cross-Platform Path Handling**: Replaced hardcoded Windows path joins in Electron viewer utilities with platform-aware path resolution to keep desktop-only actions working more reliably on macOS and Linux.

### Fixed

- **ComfyUI Payload Parsing Safety**: Added size limits around base64 decode, regex fallback scanning, and zlib inflate paths to avoid oversized metadata payloads causing memory or responsiveness spikes during parsing and indexing.
- **Watcher Lifecycle IPC**: File watcher notifications now guard against destroyed renderer windows before sending events, avoiding shutdown-time errors and stray IPC churn.
- **Deduplication Helper Feedback**: Applying or clearing deduplication suggestions now surfaces visible success/error feedback instead of failing silently in the UI.
- **Electron Window Restore**: The desktop window now reopens on the last monitor with the previous size and position when that display is still available, while safely falling back to a visible screen when monitor layouts change.
- **Startup Folder Reconciliation**: Cached folders are now silently reconciled against disk on launch, so files created while the app was closed are indexed automatically instead of requiring a manual folder refresh.
- **Open-Ended Advanced Ranges**: Step and CFG filters now preserve min-only or max-only searches instead of dropping partially filled ranges.
- **Facet Value Normalization**: Models, LoRAs, samplers, schedulers, and related indexed facet values are now sanitized more aggressively during hydration and filtering, preventing malformed metadata from breaking counts, chips, or filter matches.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Indexed Folder Transfers**: Added desktop support for copying or moving images between indexed folders, including a destination picker modal, concurrent transfer handling, and preservation of tags, favorites, and shadow metadata.
- **Editable Field Context Menu**: Added a native right-click context menu with `Cut`, `Copy`, and `Paste` for editable text fields such as the search bar.
- **Metadata Selection Context Menu**: Added right-click actions for selected text in `ImageModal` and `ImagePreviewSidebar`, including `Copy` and `Search Selection` for faster filtering from prompts and metadata.
- **Viewer Annotation Hotkeys**: Added customizable image-viewer shortcuts for toggling favorites, focusing the add-tag field, and deleting the current image without leaving keyboard navigation.

### Improved

- **Large Library Browsing Performance**: Significantly improved browsing responsiveness for large libraries by separating thumbnail state from the main image collections, reducing unnecessary full-list updates as thumbnails arrive.
- **Thumbnail Loading Pipeline**: Reworked thumbnail scheduling so visible items are prioritized, background warmup is throttled, and the first visible images fill in faster during startup, folder changes, and infinite scrolling.
- **Directory Load Feedback**: Added a "Loading Library" progress bar with per-folder progress directly in the directory list, including a scanning state while totals are still being determined.
- **Directory Discovery Speed**: Greatly reduced the delay before indexing starts on large folders by parallelizing Electron-side file stat collection during directory scanning.
- **Viewer Responsiveness**: Improved Image Modal loading behavior so the full-resolution image is prioritized over background thumbnail warmup, reducing the delay after the thumbnail preview appears.
- **Viewer Generate Actions**: Added per-provider viewer toggles in Settings so Automatic1111 and ComfyUI actions can be hidden independently in Image Modal and Image Preview Sidebar, with single-provider labels simplified to `Generate`.
- **ComfyUI Metadata Compatibility**: Improved parsing for prompt-only ComfyUI graph payloads, added support for `smZ CLIPTextEncode`, and normalized prompt whitespace for cleaner imported prompts.

### Fixed

- **Search Filter**: Fixed a bug where pressing the ESC key to close the image modal would also inadvertently clear the active search filter text.
- **Settings**: Fixed a critical bug where `settings.json` could become corrupted on exit, causing user preferences (like disabling auto-updates) to reset to defaults on the next launch. Implemented atomic file saves to guarantee settings integrity.
- **Auto-Updater**: Fixed an issue where background update checks would display an intrusive error dialog if the internet was disconnected or blocked by a firewall. Also prevented cached update dialogs from appearing when the auto-update setting is disabled.
- **Draw Things**: Fixed missing LoRA weights and parsing issues for recent Draw Things metadata formats.
- **Metadata Display**: Fixed inconsistent CFG scale display for some parsed images by normalizing both `cfgScale` and `cfg_scale` metadata field variants.
- **Library Grid**: Fixed filename labels being overlapped by thumbnails below them when "Show filenames under thumbnails" was enabled.
- **Display Settings**: Fixed "Show full file path" so it now displays the actual full image path in both grid and list views, with safer truncation for long paths in the grid.
- **Thumbnail Generation During Indexing**: Fixed a regression where thumbnail generation could be blocked while a directory was still indexing, causing empty-looking grids and delayed thumbnail appearance exactly when loading a folder.
- **Folder Load Empty State**: Fixed cases where newly added or cached folders could briefly show "No images found" even though discovery or cache hydration was still in progress.
- **Electron Fallback Image Paths**: Fixed Electron image loading fallbacks for files inside subfolders so modal/sidebar/comparison views resolve the correct relative path and avoid unnecessary load failures or delays.
- **Image Source Refresh**: Fixed thumbnail/full-image refresh behavior for files that change content while keeping the same image id, reducing stale visual state after updates.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Bulk tagging support in the Tag Manager (comma-separated tags)
- Multi-image selection in the image grid
- "Go to folder" link after batch export success
- Support for additional ComfyUI nodes in metadata parsing:
  - `WanImageToVideo`
  - `KSamplarAdvanced`

- Allow users to re-include previously excluded folders directly from the directory tree sidebar.

### Improved

- Native clipboard support for copying images/files
- Export folder handling outside indexed directories
- Internal ComfyUI parser type organization

### Fixed

- Selection state and alignment issues in the virtualized image grid
- Deselection / click handling issues during multi-selection
- Tag manager event conflict around tag removal confirmation
- Ensure images from excluded subfolders are correctly filtered out from the grid view by normalizing path separators (`/` vs `\`).
- Resolve cache directory based on user settings to ensure the correct path is used.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- **Video & GIF Support**: Early implementation of support for video formats (MP4, WEBM) and GIFs, allowing indexing, thumbnail display, and playback within the viewer.

- **Prompt Library**: Fixed crashes/instability in the Prompt Library (IndexedDB errors).
- **Cache Management**: Refactored cache manager code to adhere to best practices.
- **Indexing Resiliency**: Fixed an issue where interrupted indexing operations left files with incomplete metadata (stubs) in the cache that never got re-indexed. The system now automatically detects these incomplete entries on startup/refresh and forces them to be fully enriched, eliminating the need to clear cache after an interrupted scan.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-01-24

### Improved

### Added

- **External Drag & Drop**: Enabled native drag and drop support for images in the Gallery View. Users can now directly drag images from the application to external programs (ComfyUI, Photoshop, Discord, file explorer, etc.) for a seamless workflow.

### Fixed

- **Forge Metadata Parsing**: Fixed "No normalized metadata available" issue for images created with newer Forge versions (f2.0.1+). The Forge backend update removed "Forge"/"Gradio" keywords from metadata, causing images to fall through to A1111 parser. Updated detection logic to recognize Forge version patterns (`/Version:\s*f\d+\./i`) in addition to keyword matching. (Issue #108)
- **Image Compare Mode - Hover & Slider**: Fixed critical rendering bug where images appeared as black screen in Hover and Slider comparison modes. The issue was caused by `react-zoom-pan-pinch` wrapper not receiving explicit height styles, causing the container to collapse to 0px height. Added `wrapperStyle` and `contentStyle` inline styles to force proper dimensions.

### Improved

- **Auto-Watch Instant Sync**: Activating auto-watch now triggers an immediate folder refresh, ensuring the gallery is instantly synchronized with the current directory state without waiting for the next file change event.
- **Image Compare Mode - Slider Interaction**: Significantly improved slider usability:
  - Expanded clickable area from 1px to 40px (20px on each side of the divider line) for much easier dragging

- **LoRA Weight Extraction**: All parsers (Automatic1111, Forge, SDNext, Fooocus, EasyDiffusion, DreamStudio, InvokeAI) now extract LoRA weights from `<lora:name:weight>` syntax and return structured `LoRAInfo` objects instead of plain strings
- **InvokeAI LoRA Weight Support**: InvokeAI parser now extracts weights from both prompt tags (`<lora:...>`, `<lyco:...>`) and InvokeAI's native metadata structure `{ model: { name }, weight }`
- **Preserve Original Prompts**: Removed automatic stripping of `<lora:...>` tags from prompts to preserve the user's original prompt text exactly as written. LoRAs are still extracted separately to the dedicated LoRAs field
- **ComfyUI Hybrid Parser Architecture**: Parser now uses a priority-based extraction system: (1) MetaHub chunk (instant, zero dependencies), (2) Graph traversal (fallback for standard ComfyUI exports), (3) Regex extraction (last resort).

## [0.10.5] - 2025-12-16

### Major Performance Improvements

- **3-5x Faster Loading**: Batch IPC operations reduce 1000+ individual calls to a single batch in cache loading and file operations
- **40-60% Fewer Re-renders**: Granular Zustand selectors optimize component updates across App.tsx, ComparisonModal.tsx, and ImageGrid.tsx
- **Phase B Optimizations**: Metadata enrichment now ~13ms per file (down from ~30ms) with header-based dimension reading, batch tuning, and optimized buffer reuse
- **Smoother Navigation**: Bounded thumbnail queue with stale request cancellation prevents outdated jobs from overwriting newer loads

### Added

- **Compare Modes: Slider & Hover**: New comparison modes alongside side-by-side: drag a divider to reveal each image or hover to flip between them, selectable via the mode toggle in the comparison header.
- **Mode-Aware Sync Controls**: Sync toggle is now clearly tied to side-by-side mode, with contextual hints per mode.

### Changed

- **Bounded Thumbnail Queue**: Thumbnail loading now uses a max-concurrency queue with cancellation of stale requests, preventing outdated jobs from overwriting newer loads during rapid navigation.
- **Debounced Full-Image Fallbacks**: Grid and table views delay heavy fallback reads by ~180ms when thumbnails aren't ready, reducing bursty I/O when paginating quickly.
- **Phase B Header Dimensions**: Metadata enrichment reads PNG/JPEG dimensions directly from file headers, skipping full image decode for width/height.
- **Phase B Batch Tuning**: Larger enrichment batches, timed dirty-chunk flushing, and parallel cache rewrites cut IPC/disk churn during metadata extraction.
- **Phase B Throughput Gains**: Optimized buffer reuse and looser flush thresholds dropped average Phase B time per file to ~13 ms on test sets

### Performance

- **Batch Path Joins**: Implemented batch IPC handler `join-paths-batch` for path joining operations, reducing 1000+ individual IPC calls to a single batch call in cache loading and file handle operations (3-5x faster).
- **Reduced JSON Operations**: Optimized `fileIndexer.ts` to skip `JSON.stringify` for empty rawMetadata objects, avoiding unnecessary serialization overhead.
- **Component Memoization**: Added `React.memo` to `Sidebar.tsx` and `ImagePreviewSidebar.tsx` components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed.
- **Granular Store Selectors**: Refactored `App.tsx`, `ComparisonModal.tsx`, and `ImageGrid.tsx` to use granular Zustand selectors instead of mass destructuring, reducing unnecessary re-renders by 40-60%.
- **Optimized ImageCard Memoization**: Replaced expensive `JSON.stringify()` tag comparison with efficient `join()` method in `ImageGrid.tsx`, improving grid rendering performance.
- **Memoized ImageTableRow**: Added `React.memo` with custom comparison to `ImageTableRow` component, preventing unnecessary re-renders in table view.
- **Optimized Table Sorting**: Wrapped `applySorting` function in `useCallback` to avoid recreation on every render, improving sorting performance for large datasets.
- **Throttled Drag-to-Select**: Implemented `requestAnimationFrame` throttling for drag-to-select intersection calculations, providing smoother UX without UI blocking.
- **Debounced Filter Inputs**: Added 300ms debounce to advanced filter inputs, reducing filter recalculations by ~70% during user input while maintaining responsive UI.

## [0.10.4] - 2025-12-10

### Added

### Changed

- **Build Guard for Licenses**: Builds now fail early if `IMH_LICENSE_SECRET` is missing or still the placeholder, preventing broken Pro activations in shipped binaries.

### Fixed

- **ComfyUI Compressed Workflow Parsing**: Fixed ComfyUI prompt parsing from compressed iTXt PNG chunks and added case-insensitive workflow detection for better compatibility.
- **PNG iTXt Decompression**: Ensure deflate chunks are copied into a real `ArrayBuffer` before piping through `DecompressionStream`, avoiding `SharedArrayBuffer`/Blob type errors in builds.
- **Zlib Fallback**: Use dynamic `import('zlib')` in the renderer fallback path to keep eslint happy and avoid `require` in ESM.

### Developer

- **WebCrypto License Validation**: License validation now runs in the renderer using WebCrypto, with Node fallback for CLI/scripts, removing the browser `crypto` externalization error.

## [0.10.3] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- **Refined Folder Tree**: Implemented tri-state folder checkboxes with inherited selection rules, making it easy to combine root folders with individual subfolders.
- **Persistent Folder Visibility**: Folder inclusion state now survives restarts through IndexedDB-backed storage, ensuring directory preferences stick between sessions.
- **Updated Branding**: Replaced the stock assets with the new `logo1.svg` splash illustration and matching application icon for Windows builds.

### Changed

- **Default Subfolder Scanning**: Recursive scanning is now enabled by default and enforced on first-run to provide a complete library immediately.
- **Simplified Folder Selector**: Removed the initial "Scan Subfolders" toggle—subfolder indexing is always on and folder visibility is now managed directly from the sidebar tree.
- **Unified Version Display**: Updated all visible version strings (header, welcome screen, Electron window title, CLI, and status bar) to `0.9.5`.

### Fixed

- Resolved folder selection inconsistencies that hid images when expanding directories by introducing tri-state hierarchy rules and persistent IndexedDB-backed folder selection state.
- Addressed directory selection regressions where newly expanded subfolders could hide their images until the view was refreshed.

### Performance Improvements

- **Optimized Indexing Phase B**:
  - Propagated file size, type, and birthtime details from Electron's directory listing through the entire indexing pipeline to eliminate per-file IPC calls for stat information during enrichment phase.
  - Increased enrichment batch size from 128 to 256 to reduce cache flushes while maintaining UI responsiveness.
  - Skip unnecessary Easy Diffusion sidecar reads when metadata is already detected from PNG chunks.
  - Muted verbose debug logs (`[PNG DEBUG]`, `[FILE DEBUG]`, `[SwarmUI DEBUG]`) in production builds to reduce console overhead.
  - These optimizations reduce Phase B overhead without affecting processing logic or making phase B optional.

## [0.9.4] - 2025-10-20

### Fixed
